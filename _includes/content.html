<p>I'm a PhD student in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
My interests currently tend towards behavioral economics and industrial organization in the context of developing countries.</p>

<p>Before coming to Madison, I worked as a Research Associate with Innovations for Poverty Action in Dakar, Senegal. The project aimed to test
a number of interventions in the urban sanitation services market. <a href="http://www.poverty-action.org/project/0574">More about our project.</a></p> 

<p>My primary responsibilities in this role were to build surveys using SurveyCTO and develop our monitoring and analysis capabilities using Stata and R. I have also supported the testing and scale-up of a call center for sanitation services, which sets prices using SMS-based auctions.</p>

<p>The PIs on the project were <a href="http://www.jeanfrancoishoude.info/WordPress/">Jean-François Houde</a>, <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/mlipscomb/Molly_Lipscomb/Home.html">Molly Lipscomb</a>, and <a href="https://www.aae.wisc.edu/lschechter/">Laura Schechter</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant for <a href="http://djavadsalehi.com/">Djavad Salehi-Isfahani</a>. I also worked as a Research Analyst at <a href="http://www.kcoe.com/featured-services/sustainability/">Vela Environmental</a> on climate policy and sustainability issues.</p>
